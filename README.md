# The Fli3d Project

## Purpose

Fli3d (pronounced "flight") is a project by Jean-Marc Wislez for the 2020 edition of the Belgian "Fri3d Camp" hacker event. Its purpose is to develop and launch an ESP32 payload on top of a microrocket.

The name is obviously derived from "Fri3d Camp", and hints to the "Chinese electronics" used to build it.

## Overview

## Flights

To date, the payload has not flown yet.  It is hoped to do one or more test flights before Fri3d Camp in August 2020, and one or more demo flights at Fri3d Camp.

Each flight will be designated through a successive starting letter, and have a corresponding name (another cheesy reference to the Chinese electronics used):
  - Fli3d Aubergine 
  - Fli3d Banana 
  - Fli3d Chicken
  - Fli3d Dumplings
  - Fli3d Eggs
  - ...
  - Fli3d Rice
